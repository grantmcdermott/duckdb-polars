**Date:** Thursday, May 2nd, 18:00 - 20:00 CEST (Rome, Berlin, Paris timezone).
A recording of the workshop will be available for attendees who cannot make
the live stream.

**Description:** This workshop will introduce you to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and
[Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars), two data wrangling libraries at the
frontier of high-performance computation. (See
[benchmarks](https://duckdblabs.github.io/db-benchmark/).) In addition to being
extremely fast and portable, both DuckDB and Polars provide user-friendly
implementations across multiple languages. This makes them very well suited to
production and applied research settings, without the overhead of tools like
Spark. We will provide a variety of real-life examples in both R and Python,
with the aim of getting participants up and running as quickly as possible. We
will learn how wrangle datasets extending over several hundred million
observations in a matter of seconds or less, using only our laptops. And we will
learn how to scale to even larger contexts where the data exceeds our computers’
RAM capacity. Finally, we will also discuss some complementary tools and how
these can be integrated for an efficient end-to-end workflow (data I/O ->
wrangling -> analysis).
